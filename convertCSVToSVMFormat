Description: If you have a csv file, when you want to convert to SVMFormat
i.e, label index:value index:value index:value .....
5 1:20 3:45 10:8
It means label is 5 and the above record has value 20 at index 1 , value of 45 at position 3 and value 8 at position 10.
This compresses the data very well.
indexes other than mentioned is considered to have zero value.
No place for negative number  :D
*/


val convertToSVMFormat = data.map { line =>
val parts = line.split(",");
var result = parts(0);
for( index <- 1 to parts.length-1){
if(parts(index).toDouble >0) {result = result +" "+ index+":"+parts(index)}
}
(result)
}
